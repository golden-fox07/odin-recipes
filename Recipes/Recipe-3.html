    <p>This delicious tiramisu made with homemade mascarpone custard (no raw eggs),
      layers of whipped cream, and rum and coffee-soaked ladyfingers is an impressive Italian dessert.
      Dust the top of the tiramisu with cocoa powder before serving.</p>

    <ol>
      <li><p>Add whipping cream to a mixing bowl and beat on medium speed with electric mixers (or use a stand mixer). 
        Slowly add sugar and vanilla and continue to beat until stiff peaks.
        Add mascarpone cheese and fold in until combined. Set aside.</p></li>
      <li><p>Add coffee and liqueur to a shallow bowl.
        Dip the lady fingers in the coffee (Don't soak them--just quickly dip them on both sides to get them wet)
        and lay them in a single layer on the bottom of an 8x8'' or similar size pan</p></li>
      <li><p>Smooth half of the mascarpone mixture over the top.
        Add another layer of dipped lady fingers. Smooth remaining mascarpone cream over the top.</p></li>
      <li><p>Dust cocoa powder generously over the top 
        (I use a fine mesh strainer to do this). Refrigerate for at least 3-4
        hours or up to overnight before serving.</p></li>
    </ol>

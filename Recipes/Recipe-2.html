    <div class = "paragraph"><p>Crème brûlée is a decadent French dessert consisting of a custard base and a caramelized sugar crust. 
      The treat is traditionally served in individual ramekins. You can use a butane torch to achieve the perfect 
      caramelization if you'd like, but this crème brûlée recipe is easily finished under your oven's broiler. </p></div>
